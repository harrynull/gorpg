# GoRPG

This is a mini game written for learning golang. It has a similar rule to "Tower of the Sorcerer."

It is not made to be playable but it's a fun way for me to learn a new language. As such,
please don't expect it to follow any best practices. It uses
[Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) for graphics.

Currently I have no plan for futher development on this project.
